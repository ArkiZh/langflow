## Nodes

`TimeTravelGuideChain` will provide you with the historical period or future time you want to visit and you will suggest the best events, sights, or people to experience. **Output Key** and **Input Key** are simply unique identifiers used to represent the data being passed between different modules.

The `ConversationSummaryMemory`. A memory of this type creates a summary of the conversation over time, which can be useful for condensing information. The **memory key** input is typically generated by encoding the input text using an encoder network, which maps the input text into a fixed-dimensional vector representation. We used **history** as *default*.

We used `OpenAI` as the LLM, but you can use any LLM that has an API. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider. For example, [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys){.internal-link target=_blank} requires you to create an account to get it yours.

Check the short tutorial of [OpenAI](llms.md){.internal-link target=_blank} options available.

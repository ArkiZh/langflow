## Contributing to ‚õìÔ∏èLangFlow

Hello there! We appreciate your interest in contributing to LangFlow.
As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open
to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infra, or better documentation.

To contribute to this project, please follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects){.internal-link target=_blank} workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.

### üö©GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/issues){.internal-link target=_blank} page is kept up to date
with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. There is a taxonomy of labels to help
with sorting and discovery of issues of interest.

If you're looking for help with your code, consider posting a question on the
[GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/discussions){.internal-link target=_blank}. Please
understand that we won't be able to provide individual support via email. We
also believe that help is much more valuable if it's **shared publicly**,
so that more people can benefit from it.

- **Describing your issue:** Try to provide as many details as possible. What
  exactly goes wrong? _How_ is it failing? Is there an error?
  "XY doesn't work" usually isn't that helpful for tracking down problems. Always
  remember to include the code you ran and if possible, extract only the relevant
  parts and don't just dump your entire script. This will make it easier for us to
  reproduce the error.

- **Sharing long blocks of code or logs:** If you need to include long code,
  logs or tracebacks, you can wrap them in `<details>` and `</details>`. This
  [collapses the content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details){.internal-link target=_blank}
  so it only becomes visible on click, making the issue easier to read and follow.

### Issue labels

[See this page](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/labels){.internal-link target=_blank} for an overview of
the system we use to tag our issues and pull requests.

### Local development
You can develop LangFlow using docker compose, or locally.

#### **Docker compose**
This will run the backend and frontend in separate containers. The frontend will be available at `localhost:3000` and the backend at `localhost:7860`.
```bash
docker compose up --build
# or
make dev build=1
```

#### **Locally**
Run locally by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies from your system.

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
  - Poetry
  - Node.js

For the backend, you will need to install the dependencies and start the development server.
```bash
poetry install
make run_backend
```
For the frontend, you will need to install the dependencies and start the development server.
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

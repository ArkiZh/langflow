## 🙏 Help others with questions on GitHub

You can try and help others with their questions in the:

- <a href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/discussions" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Discussions</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/issues" class="external-link" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a>

In many cases, you might already know the answer to those questions. 🤓

Just remember, the most important point is: to try to be kind. People come with their frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to be kind. 🤗

The idea is for the **LangFlow** community to be kind and welcoming. At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior toward others. We have to take care of each other.

Here's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):

### Understand the question

- Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person asking.

- Then check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is **clear**.

- In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**.

- If you can't understand the question, ask for more **details**.

### Reproduce the problem

For most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's **original code**.

In many cases, they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to **reproduce the problem**.

- If you are feeling too generous, you can try to **create an example** like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just have in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.

### Suggest solutions

- After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible **answer**.

- In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem or use case**, because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.

### Ask to close

If they reply, there's a high chance you would've solved their problem, congrats, **you're a hero**!🦸

- Now, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:

  - In GitHub Discussions: mark the comment as the **answer**.
  - In GitHub Issues: **close** the issue\*\*.

### Ask Questions

You can <a href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/discussions/categories/q-a" class="external-link" target="_blank">create a new question</a> in the GitHub repository, for example to:

- Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
- Suggest a new **feature**.

**Note**: if you do it, then we are going to ask you to also help others. 😉

### Review Pull Requests

You can help us review pull requests from others.

Again, please try your best to be kind. 🤗

---

Here's what to have in mind and how to review a pull request:

### Understand the problem

- First, make sure you **understand the problem** that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.

- There's also a good chance that the pull request is not needed because the problem can be solved in a **different way**. Then you can suggest or ask about that.

### Don't worry about style

- Don't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.

- Also don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.

And if there's any other style or consistency needed, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.

### Check the code

- Check and read the code, see if it makes sense, **run it locally** and see if it solves the problem.

- Then **comment** saying that you did that, that's how I will know you checked it.

!!! info
Unfortunately, we can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.

    Several times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5, or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. 😅

    So, it's really important that you read and run the code, and let us know in the comments that you did. 🤓

- If the PR can be simplified in a way, you can ask for that, but there's no need to be too picky, there might be a lot of subjective points of view (and we will have our own as well 🙈), so it's better if you can focus on the fundamental things.

### Tests

- Help us check that the PR has **tests**.

- Check that the tests **fail** before the PR. 🚨

- Then check that the tests **pass** after the PR. ✅

- Many PRs don't have tests, you can **remind** them to add tests, or you can even **suggest** some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume the most time and you can help a lot with that.

- They also comment on what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓

### Create a Pull Request

- To fix a typo you found on the documentation.
- To propose new documentation sections.
- To fix an existing issue/bug.
  - Make sure to add tests.
- To add a new feature.
  - Make sure to add tests.
  - Make sure to add documentation if it's relevant.

### Help Maintain LangFlow

Help us maintain **LangFlow**! 🤓

There's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, **YOU** can do it.

The main tasks that you can do right now are:

- [Help others with questions in GitHub](#help-others-with-questions-in-github){.internal-link target=\_blank} (see the section above).
- [Review Pull Requests](#review-pull-requests){.internal-link target=\_blank} (see the section above).

Those two tasks are what **consume time the most**. That's the main work of maintaining LangFlow.

If you can help us with that, **you are helping us maintain LangFlow** and making sure it keeps **advancing faster and better**. 🚀

# üìù Guidelines

## Node

During the flow creation process, you will notice a colored circle <span style="color:green">o</span>. Components marked with a red asterisk <span style="color:red">\*</span> must be connected. If you don't connect it, a red line will appear around it. Make the necessary connections to make your flow work. Hovering over the small circle will reveal the component that needs to be connected.

<br>

In some nodes, at the top of it, you will see a small gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è, which you can click to edit the component's parameters. You also have the option to delete it by clicking the trash can icon üóëÔ∏è.

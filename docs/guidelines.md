# 📝 Guidelines

During the flow creation process, you will notice a colored circle <span style="color:green">o</span>. Components marked with a red asterisk <span style="color:red">*</span> must be connected. If you don't connect it, a red line will appear around it. Make the necessary connections to make your flow work. Hovering over the small circle will reveal the component that needs to be connected.

In some nodes, at the top of it, you will see a small gear icon ⚙️, which you can click to edit the component's parameters. You also have the option to delete it by clicking the trash can icon 🗑️.

Flows can be exported and imported as JSON files. We already have some examples on **Import** option, check them out.

The background color can be set to light ☀️ or dark 🌙. The bell icon 🔔 indicates that the component has a notification.

We used `OpenAI` as the LLM, but you can use any LLM that has an API. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider. For example, [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/){.internal-link target=_blank} requires you to create an account to get your API key.

Check the short tutorial of [OpenAI](llms.md){.internal-link target=_blank} options available.

The `ConversationSummaryMemory`. A memory of this type creates a summary of the conversation over time, which can be useful for condensing information. The **memory key** input is typically generated by encoding the input text using an encoder network, which maps the input text into a fixed-dimensional vector representation. We used **history** as *default*.

With `SeriesCharacterChain`, you can chat with the characters in the series you like most. You can just type the name of the character and the series, and the bot will start chatting with the character.

Character:
    
``` txt
Gandalf
```

Series:
    
``` txt
The Lord of the Rings
```

Play around with it and see how it works!

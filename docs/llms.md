Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of the flow. LangFlow is not a provider of LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface through which you can interact with a variety of LLMs.

The LLM class is a class designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.
